Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education, language education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Evaluative or thick conceptions[b] of education state that it is part of the nature of education to lead to some kind of improvement. They contrast with thin conceptions, which provide a value-neutral explanation.[13] Some theorists provide a descriptive conception of education by observing how the term is commonly used in ordinary language. Prescriptive conceptions, by contrast, define what good education is or how education should be practiced.[14] Many thick and prescriptive conceptions see education as an activity that tries to achieve certain aims,[15] which may range from acquiring knowledge and learning to think rationally to nurturing character traits like kindness and honesty.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Various scholars stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.[17] They state that mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the student, independent of whether the beliefs are rational;[18] whereas education also fosters the rational ability to critically reflect on and question those beliefs.[19] It is not universally accepted that these two phenomena can be clearly distinguished since some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of education while the child's mind is not yet sufficiently developed. This applies to cases in which young children need to learn something without being able to understand the underlying reasons, like certain safety rules and hygiene practices.</p>
